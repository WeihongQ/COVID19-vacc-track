## Directory Structure
In `front-end`, we work with a jQuery + Bootstrap website, where each page is a separate HTML file. This is the front-end of the website, and is for the convenience of using PHP later.

In `back-end`, we work with a PHP script that will handle the logic of the website. It communicates with the SQL database. There are edits to the previously made front-end during the back-end developing process.
